Lab exercises of the Packet Switching and Processing Architectures course of the Computer Science and Networking Master's Degree @ University of Pisa

| <b>Lab number</b> | <b>Language/Framework/Tool</b> | <b>Description</b> |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| 1 | C++, libpcap | A simple program that takes an interface as input parameter. It first checks if the interface is in the list of devices returned by `pcap_findalldevs()`: if yes it calls the `pcap_open_live()` on that interface, otherwise a valid interface is requested. Once the descriptor has been correctly opened a packet will be captured with the `pcap_next()` and some information on its content will be printed out. |
| 2 | C++, libpcap | A simple program that takes a pcap file as input parameter. A descriptor is obtained with the `pcap_open_offline()`. The `pcap_next()` is used and some information on the content of the captured packet will be printed out. VLAN traffic ([IEEE 802.1Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q)) has been managed. |
| 3 | C++, libpcap | A simple program that takes as input parameters a pcap file and the number of packets to be captured. A descriptor is obtained with the `pcap_open_offline()`. The `pcap_loop()` is used and a packet handler callback is defined. The callback is supposed to be called on a per-packet basis and implements the parsers of the protocol headers. |
| 4 | C++, libpcap | A program that obtains packets from a pcap file and does some analysis. It requires as input parameters a pcap file and the number of packets to be captured. The computation returns the number (and the list) of the different source IP addresses found in the analyzed traffic. |
| 5 | C++, libpcap | A program that uses the [pcap](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap) library to capture some traffic and identifies and analyzes different flows. The user can specify as input parameters both a network interface or a pcap capture file, along with the number of packets that he wants to analyze. In the first case the capture is done using the `pcap_open_live()` while in the second case the `pcap_open_offline()` is used. The aim of the program is to identify different flows (where a flow is a tuple composed by source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port and protocol) and to count how many packets belong to a certain flow. <br>Two different implementations are provided: <ul><li>an unordered map where the keys are the flow tuples and the values are the packet counters for each flow; only C++ base mechanism and library are used in this case.</li><li>a counting bloom filter randomized data structure used to check set membership for the flows and to count the packets per flow; the [MurmurHash3](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher) function has been used in order to produce 128-bit hash values efficiently.</li></ul> The program output is a table containing a summary of the results produced by the two approaches and showing consistency between them: for each flow the number of counted packets (stored in the map) is printed out along with the counter values retrieved from the bloom filter. |
